[[example-etag]]
= ETag switch

By link:../api/index#behaviour[default], an ETag is generated from the asset and sent along with the response as a header, in XP prod run mode. In link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/enonic-cli/master/dev#start[XP dev mode], no ETag is generated.

This default behaviour can be overridden with the `etag` option. If set to `true`, an ETag will always be generated, even in XP dev mode. If set to `false`, no ETag is generated, even in XP prod mode:

[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
const getStatic = libStatic.buildGetter({
    root: 'my/folder',
    etag: false
});
