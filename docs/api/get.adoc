= .get
A specific-recource getter method, returns a link:#behaviour[response object] for the particular asset that's named in the argument string.

Three optional and equivalent syntaxes:

`const response = libStatic.get(path);`

`const response = libStatic.get(path, options);`

`const response = libStatic.get(optionsWithPath);`


== Params:
- `path` (string): path and full file name to an asset file, relative to the JAR root (or relative to _build/resources/main_ in XP dev mode, see link:#buildgetter-params[the 'root' param explanation] above. Cannot contain `..` or any of the characters `: | < > ' " Â´ * ?` or backslash or backtick.
- `options` (object): add an link:#options[options object] after `path` to control behaviour for this specific response.
- `optionsWithPath` (object): same as above, an link:#options[options object] but when used as the first and only argument, this object _must_ include a `{ path: ..., }` attribute too - a path string same as above. This is simply for convenience if you prefer named parameters instead of a positional `path` argument. If both are supplied, the positional `path` argument is used.

If `path` (either as a string argument or as an attribute in a `options` object) resolves to (or outside) the JAR root, contains `..` or any of the characters `: | < > ' " Â´ * ?` or backslash or backtick, or is missing or empty, an error is thrown.
