# lib-static

[Enonic XP](https://enonic.com/developer-tour) library for serving assets from a folder in the XP folder structure. 

Intended and optimized for static files, i.e. files whose content aren't meant to change - so will aim for "perfect client-side caching" in response headers. Modeled as a simplified and XP-specific version of [serve-static](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve-static), with a simple but configurable usage.
